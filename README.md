### Secuchat

<h3>To be updated soon<h3>

## Getting Started With Flutter Documentation

The Project was made to improve the current privacy fiasco of chat apps.

We opened the source code so that you can audit our app and request for merge while making you in control of what we store about you. While we are working on shifting our current operations from firebase to own cloud, rest assured it would be done by in future.

A few resources to get you started if you want to build this app yourself.

- [Lab: SecuChat](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

We expect nothing less than respectful criticization while actively working on OUR(which includes but NOT LIMITED TO EVERYONE USING OR WORKING on it) APP.
